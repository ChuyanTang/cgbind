Install
=======

cgbind is built in Python 3 and has been tested with v. 3.7. An `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`_ or
`miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ installation is highly recommended to easily install the
dependencies.

.. note::
    The `autode <https://duartegroup.github.io/autodE/install.html>`_ package is an optional dependency and must be
    installed prior to ``cgbind``, to perform semi-emprical, DFT and ab initio calculations.
